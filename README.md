# INFOR-NEWS :argentina:

# Welcome to my ReactJS project! :wave::relaxed:

I developed this application as the final project of the "***Informatorio Chaco***" academy's course.


The aim of this project is call and consume an external API of News and show all content from the response.


This project only require one API of news and nothing else, but I have added 2 more API, one of Weather and another of the currently value of USD to ARS and I display them on the header component.


## API's in this App:

1. [News API (only works on localhost)](https://newsapi.org/)
2. [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
3. [bluelytics](https://bluelytics.com.ar/#!/api)
